Hello,

Welcome to my github page!

My name is Jacob Mach, a South Sudanese Canadian, who is currently on tour around Africa.

My educational background is in Chemical Engineering. I completed my Bachelor's degree at the University of Toronto and Ph.D. at the University of Ottawa. My Ph.D. project was inspired by an NSERC summer research studentship I took part in towards the end of my 3rd year of undergraduate studies. My Ph.D. work combined experiments, theory and computational modelling to study the impact of gas-liquid distribution system on bubble column hydrodynamics. Bubble columns are encountered in energy, biochemical and metallurgical processes where intimate contact between a gas and a liquid is desired. Internals such as gas-liquid distributors provide an additional mean for enhancing the contact between the phases.

My current research interests include experimental and computational study of multiphase flows and reactors, with the ultimate goal of developing tools for designing efficient multiphase reactors. I am also interested in artificial intelligence and its applications in reduced order modelling and design optimization. 

On my free time, I like to hike, play games and learn new human languages üòÅ
